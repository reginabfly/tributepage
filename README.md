# tributepage
Tribute Page Project from freeCodeCamp
This is a website we had to finish for freeCodeCamp after completing the CSS lessons. 

We had to make a tribute page of someone in our life that recently passed so I chose my dog Ginger. It had to be a very simplistic page utilizing basic html and css only.
