        <p>We adopted Ginger from Petco on October 24, 2005, only one month after we were married. We looked on
          <a href="http://www.petfinder.com"
            target="_blank">PetFinder.com</a> to find a dog that would be good for our family. Ginger was almost 2 years old when we got her.
          We were lucky enough to have her in our lives for 11 years. She lived in three homes with us, welcomed two additional
          little members to our family and forever left paw prints on our hearts!!</p>
